"""``ProviderAdapter`` ABC (GOAL-6 PR-B).

Every concrete adapter (:class:`~backend.llm.openai_compat.OpenAICompatAdapter`,
:class:`~backend.llm.anthropic.AnthropicAdapter`) implements the same three
async methods against a :class:`~backend.models.provider.ModelProvider` row,
so :func:`backend.llm.factory.get_adapter` can hand callers (PR-C's API
routes, PR-D's resolver, PR-E's consumption points) a uniform surface
regardless of which vendor SDK sits underneath.

Kept deliberately thin: ``chat()`` returns plain assistant text (not the raw
SDK response object) because PR-B has no consumer yet that needs anything
richer — a later PR can widen the return type without touching this ABC's
shape if a real need shows up. ``test_connection()`` returns a dict rather
than a dataclass so it serializes straight into an API response body (PR-C)
with no extra marshalling step.

    :class:`~backend.llm.base.ConnectionTestResult`'s ``error`` field — SDK
    exceptions can echo back request details (e.g. a vendor's HTTP client
    repr'ing its own auth header) and this is the one seam that guarantees
